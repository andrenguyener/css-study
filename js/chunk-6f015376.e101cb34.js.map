Great, let's now compare it to the others.</p>\n    <br>\n    <p>\n      The next one is also not an inline style. So, 0 for the first one. Now here we actually have an ID selector for the #nav ID right. So it's a 1 for the ID. We also have two classes .container and\n      .button, so it's a 2 for the classes category. Finally, there are also two element selectors here; the nav element and the div element which means that it's also 2 for the elements category.\n    </p>\n    <ModalImage src=\"cascade-specificity/button3.png\"></ModalImage>\n    <p>So finally, the specificity to this selector is 0, 1, 2, 2 which is actually a highly specific selector.</p>\n    <br>\n    <p>Selector number three is very simple; it's just an element selector and so the specificity is 0, 0, 0, 1.</p>\n    <ModalImage src=\"cascade-specificity/button4.png\"></ModalImage>\n    <p>\n      Now the last one, selector number four. First again we have the #nav ID, so it's 1 for the ID. Next we have a class, the button class and also a pseudo class, which is hover which makes it 2 for the classes category in total. Since there's also one element selector the\n      final specificity is 0, 1, 2, 1. Make sense?\n    </p>\n    <ModalImage src=\"cascade-specificity/button5.png\"></ModalImage>\n    <p>You're probably wondering well this is all great but how do we actually use these numbers to find out which of the selectors applies?</p>\n    <br>\n    <p>We start to look at the numbers from left to right starting with the most specific category, the inline styles. If there is the selector with one it wins against all the other selectors because this is the most specific category. Well this is not the case here, so let's move on to the IDS. We see that selector two and four have a 1 here while the others have 0 so the ones with 0 are out of the game because they are less specific than selectors two and four, the ones with the IDS.</p>\n    <ModalImage src=\"cascade-specificity/button6.png\"></ModalImage>\n    <p>Okay, now since both selectors have a one in this category we have to move on and check the classes. They both have a 2 in this category so it's still a tie between them. Finally, in the elements category the selector two as a 2 while the selector for has only 1. We have a winner!</p>\n    <ModalImage src=\"cascade-specificity/button7.png\"></ModalImage>\n    <p>\n      Here the selector number two is the most specific selector of all and so it will\n      give our button a purple background. The value of the winning declaration is called the cascaded value because as a result from the Cascade. So, we start with a bunch of declared values in this case red, purple, blue, and green and one of them wins and becomes the cascaded value which is in our example purple.\n    </p>\n    <br>\n    <p>\n      Now imagine selector four also add two elements then both selectors two and four will have the exact same specificity, right? So, what happens in this case, well if they're still a tie at this\n      point then the last CSS declaration written in the code is the one that will apply.\n    </p>\n    <ModalImage src=\"cascade-specificity/css-order4.png\"></ModalImage>\n    <p>\n      So again, if everything is equal; if all the declaration selectors have the same specificity then it's simply the\n      last declaration that will be used to style the selected element. That’s it.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Cascade and Specificity: Important Takeaways</h2>\n    <p>Let me give you a quick summary and overview of the most important things we just learned, this is essentially what you should really retain. First off, we learned that CSS declarations marked with !important keyword have the highest priority when multiple declarations are in conflict.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"list-item\">CSS declarations marked with !important have the highest priority</h3>\n    <p>\n      But, you should only ever use important as a last resource. If something doesn't work the way you think it should then look at your selector specificities and figure out what's going on. That's always better than just adding !important which may solve the problem in an easier way but will cause you problems in the long run.\n      Remember to think about maintainable code; well, thinking about specificities and using !important only as the last resource is one of the things that will make your code more maintainable for the future.\n    </p>\n    <h3\n      class=\"list-item\"\n    >But, only use !important as a last resource. It's better to use correct specificities -- more maintanable code</h3>\n    <p>\n      The next thing to remember is that inline styles that you\n      write in your HTML will always have priority over styles you write in an external stylesheet.\n      But, since using inline styles isn't such a good practice anyway this one isn't all too important.\n    </p>\n    <h3\n      class=\"list-item\"\n    >Inline styles will always have priority over styles in external stylesheets</h3>\n    <p>Next a selector that contains even only one ID is more specific than one with a thousand classes. So, if you want to be really specific, use an ID.</p>\n    <h3 class=\"list-item\">A selector that contains 1 ID is more specific than one with 1000 classes</h3>\n    <p>In the same way, a selector with one class is more specific than one with a thousand elements of course.</p>\n    <h3\n      class=\"list-item\"\n    >A selector that contains 1 class is more specific than one with 1000 elements</h3>\n    <p>\n      One thing that is really important to note is that the universal selector * has no specificity value and so at 0, 0, 0, 0.\n      Which means that all selectors have a precedence over it.\n    </p>\n    <h3 class=\"list-item\">The universal selector has * has no specificity value (0, 0, 0, 0)</h3>\n    <p>\n      Another thing that you should note is that it's best to always rely more on specificity than on\n      the order of selectors. This way if you someday rearrange all your CSS code you won't have any surprises which could mess up your entire code. This again makes your code a lot easier to maintain which is hugely important.\n    </p>\n    <h3 class=\"list-item\">Rely more on specificity than on the order of the selectors</h3>\n    <p>\n      Now there's actually one case where you do need to\n      worry about the order of selectors. That's when you're using external third-party style sheets. Imagine for instance that you include something like a reset style sheet which defines a couple of styles for common elements. In this case of course you want your stylesheet to be able to overwrite the third-party styles, so your own style sheet should be the last one to be included in the HTML. In this case the order is actually hugely important.\n    </p>\n    <h3\n      class=\"list-item\"\n    >But, rely on order when using 3rd party stylesheets - always put your author stylesheets last</h3>\n    <p>All right that's actually all there is to know about the Cascade and specificity in CSS so if you ever wondered what the cascading word in cascading style sheets actually means now you know it. Great right and the best part is that understanding all of this will now allow you to write better cleaner and more maintainable CSS code.</p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nimport ModalImage
